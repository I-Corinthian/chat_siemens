Transforming Siemens Manuals with RAG and Vector Databases
Technical documentation is essential, but searching through lengthy PDFs for specific answers is inefficient. To address this, I developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that makes Siemens PLC manuals instantly searchable and accessible.

Technologies Used:
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) – for efficient vector-based retrieval
Ollama’s nomic-embed-text – for generating high-quality text embeddings
DeepSeek-Coder:33B – a powerful LLM to generate precise, context-aware answers
LangChain – for seamless integration of retrieval and generation workflows
How It Works:
Document Processing – Siemens S7-1200 and S7-1500 manuals were converted into vector embeddings
Vector Search – FAISS enables fast semantic retrieval based on user queries
RAG Pipeline – The retrieved content is passed to DeepSeek-Coder for accurate, context-driven responses
Key Benefits:
Eliminates the need for manual document searches
Provides accurate and context-aware answers in real-time
Scales efficiently for expanding knowledge bases
This approach is highly adaptable and can be applied to any technical documentation. If you're interested in enhancing and expanding this database, or applying RAG to other domains, feel free to connect.
